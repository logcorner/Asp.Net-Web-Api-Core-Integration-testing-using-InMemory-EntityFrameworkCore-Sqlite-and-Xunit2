** USAGE NOTES **

You should install the TypeScript 1.7 for Visual Studio extension on your development system prior
to installing this package. You should also let Visual Studio make initial updates to the project
file by adding at least one .ts file to the project.
When the installation finishes, you should be prompted to reload the project.


** UNINSTALLATION NOTES **

Uninstalling will undo the changes made to the project file. It is possible that a prompt will
appear during uninstallation, telling you to to discard your changes to the project file when
Visual Studio detects the file has been changed outside the environment.


** UPGRADE NOTES **

It is highly recommended to uninstall this package prior to upgrading your project to a new
TypeScript release. This will revert changes made to the project file, which should allow
Visual Studio to perform the upgrade cleanly.
After the upgrade is performed, reinstall the appropriate version of this package that matches the
new TypeScript version.
